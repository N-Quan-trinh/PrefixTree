# PrefixTree
The Trie tree(Prefix tree) is an algorithm designed for storing a set of character in an orderly way, depending on the word being added. Each letter of a
word is stored in a tree node, inturns, the nodes are linked together. What make this tree superior to tradtional ways of storing is that, by looking at 
each word like a path to traverse, we can dramatically reduced the space complextity, reducing the needs for creating nodes for chacracter that already
existed.
